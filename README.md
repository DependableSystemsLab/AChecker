# AChecker
AChecker (Access Control Checker) is an automated static analysis tool for detecting access control vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts.

For more details about AChecker, please reference our paper published in ICSE 2023 [AChecker: Statically Detecting Smart Contract
Access Control Vulnerabilities](https://blogs.ubc.ca/dependablesystemslab/2022/12/08/achecker-statically-detecting-smart-contract-access-control-vulnerabilities)

## Getting Started
**Note:** We tested all scripts provided in this package on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine.

### Requirements
* Python 3.8+

### Building AChecker 

To build the tool manually, we provide a `requirements.txt` file and the script `setup.py` to simply install the dependencies AChecker requires and build everything as follows.

Run the following command. Please make sure you are using Python 3.8 or higher.
  
```
cd AChecker
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
 ### Analyzing a smart contract
Use the following command to run AChecker on a contract bytecode.
 ```
python bin/achecker.py -f [path_of_the_contract_bytecode_file] -b
```      
As an example, the following command will run AChecker to analyze the contract with CVE ID 'CVE-2021-34273' in the file named '*CVE-2021-34273.code*'
```
python bin/achecker.py -f CVE-2021-34273.code -b -m 8
```

The option -m enables setting the allocated memory for the analysis (in gigabytes). In this example, the allocated memory limit is set to 8 GB. The default value is 6 GB when the option -m is not used.
